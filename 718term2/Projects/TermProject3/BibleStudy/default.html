    </ul>
    <div id="fragment-1">
       			<p>When I was about 25 years old I was challenged as a magician and as 
			a skeptic to examine the miracles of Christ from a magician's point 
			of view. In making this investigation I not only discovered that 
			Jesus Christ had to be Who He claimed to be--the Son of God and the 
			Savior of the world; but I also discovered that He is the "magic" 
			ingredient Who really makes life worth living. Since that time, in 
			my performances throughout the world I have used my talent not just 
			to entertain people but to share my deep personal faith in Christ.<br />
			<br />
			During these past years some well-meaning and sincere Christians 
			have asked me such questions as, "How can a magician be a Christian? 
			Isn't the use of magic unscriptural? What does magic have to do with 
			Christianity?," etc. The following comments are made for the purpose 
			of helping people to understand the difference between what the 
			Bible condemns as magic and the type of entertainment I do, which in 
			our time is referred to as magic. <br />
			<br />
			The dictionary gives two meanings to the word magic. The first 
			definition is as follows: "The pretended art of producing effects or 
			controlling events by charms, spells, and rituals supposed to govern 
			certain natural or supernatural forces; sorcery; witchcraft." <br />
			<br />
			The practices contained in this definition are all condemned by God 
			in the Bible. Whether these practices are claimed to be used for 
			good or not makes no difference, they are still condemned as an 
			abomination to God.<br />
			<br />
			The second definition in the dictionary is for theatrical magic: 
			"The art of producing baffling effects or illusions by sleight of 
			hand, concealed apparatus" etc. This definition describes what I do. 
			I have made a very careful study of every Hebrew and Greek word in 
			the Old and New Testaments that has been translated magician, 
			diviner, soothsayer, wizard, conjurer, astrologer, sorcerer, etc. 
			Not one of the definitions of the Greek and Hebrew words describes 
			or implies this second definition of the word magic which is used 
			for entertainment purposes and which has no relationship with occult 
			practices. There is harmony between the teachings of both 
			testaments.<br />
				</p>
    </div>
    <div id="fragment-2">
       			<p>In order to clarify my previous statements, it will serve us well to 
			study the various words used in the Scripture which are descriptive 
			of these practices which are an abomination to God. Since 
			Deuteronomy 18:9-14 is more inclusive than the other passages in 
			Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Isaiah, and Daniel, let's consider that 
			passage and the titles listed in various translations of the 
			Scripture. <br />
			<br />
			The following is a summary of these practices as explained in The 
			Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament edited by R. Laird Harris, 
			Gleason L. Archer, Jr., and Bruce K. Walked and published by Moody 
			Press.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>DIVINATION</em></strong>: The exact meaning of this practice is unknown. The word 
			seems to convey the idea of obtaining an oracle (divine 
			announcement) by means of drawing lots. <strong><em>Ezekiel 21:21-22</em></strong> is a 
			Biblical clue as to how divination may have been done.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>OBSERVER OF TIMES:</em></strong> The meaning of this word is uncertain, as the 
			list of words used in various translations indicates (practice 
			soothsaying, practice spiritism, fortune-teller, enchanter, etc.). 
			Because this word is closely related to the Hebrew word translated 
			cloud, it may refer to the reading and interpretation of cloud 
			patterns. Another thought is that this is an onomatopoetic word, a 
			word that is derived from the sound of the individual performing the 
			practice.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>ENCHANTER:</em></strong> Because of the similarity of this Hebrew word to the word 
			for snake, some scholars are of the opinion that there is a 
			connection to snake charming. Others believe that since there is a 
			similarity of hissing sounds between enchanters as they chant and 
			snakes, this accounts for the similarity of the words. <br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>WITCH:</em></strong> The RSV uses SORCERER.<strong><em> Exodus 7:11</em></strong> tells us that Pharaoh had 
			this group among his court advisors. Nebuchadnezzar also summoned 
			his sorcerers to recount his dream as reported in<strong><em> Daniel 2</em></strong>. These 
			men were using natural means to promote the belief that they truly 
			had supernatural powers and to lead the people into a superstitious, 
			pagan way of life which turned them away from the true and living 
			God.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>CHARMER: </em></strong>The Hebrew word reflects the sense of binding or casting a 
			spell. The usual translation is enchantment which refers to the 
			means that the charmer uses in attempting to influence people.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>CONSULTER OF FAMILIAR SPIRITS: </em></strong>A variety of terms including medium, 
			necromancer, ghost, and spirit of the dead, are used to describe 
			this Hebrew term. <strong><em>I Samuel 28</em></strong> describes a medium; a person who 
			supposedly can make contact with the dead.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>WIZARD:</em></strong> The root of this word comes from the Hebrew word to know, 
			and implies knowledge available only to the specially initiated and 
			not available to the ordinary person. The wizard was one who was 
			thought to be acquainted with the secrets of the nonmaterial or 
			unseen world.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>NECROMANCER:</em></strong> This is a general term given for the practice of 
			spiritualism. The Hebrew word means seeking unto the dead and is a 
			comprehensive term which includes all forms of attempting to make 
			contact with departed spirits.<br />
				</p>
	</div>
    <div id="fragment-3">
        		<p>The New Testament speaks of four magicians. Simon <strong><em>Acts 8:19-24)
			</em></strong>practiced magic in Samaria and amazed all who saw him. Along with 
			wrongly using his natural abilities to try to convince the populace 
			that he had great supernatural powers, he was also rebuked by Peter 
			for supposing that the manifestations of the Holy Spirit could be 
			purchased with money.<br />
			<br />
			Bar-Jesus or Elymas<strong><em> (Acts 13:4-12)</em></strong> was a false prophet and magician 
			who resisted Paul and Barnabus. Paul's condemnation of Elymas was 
			not because of his natural ability to perform, but rather because of 
			his wrong use of the ability and his opposition to the faith.<br />
			<br />
			Jannes and Jambres <strong><em>(II Timothy 3:8)</em></strong> are two of the Egyptian 
			magicians who opposed Moses. If they were in fact advisors to 
			Pharaoh, we may consider them in the light of the earlier study of 
			Hebrew words (See WITCH).<br />
			<br />
			The New Testament also uses various words to describe the practice 
			of magic. Among these is the word translated curious arts in <strong>
			<em>Acts 
			19:19</em></strong>. The Greek word carries the root idea of being concerned with 
			other peoples' business and is translated busybodies in<strong><em> I Timothy 
			5:13</em></strong>. It conveys the sense of interfering with other peoples' lives 
			through the practice of these curious arts.<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>MAGICIAN: </em></strong>Various forms of the Greek word magos are used to identify 
			Simon, Elymas, and the Magi who came to visit Jesus after his birth. 
			Although it is not easy to identify what the term magi precisely 
			means, they "were clearly not crude practitioners of the occult 
			arts" (see "Magic," The New International Dictionary of New 
			Testament Theology, ed. Colin Brown, published by Zondervan).<br />
			<br />
			<strong><em>SORCERER:</em></strong> As used in the book of Revelation, sorcerer is translated 
			from the Greek word pharmakos, and carries with it the idea of 
			medicine, magic potion, drugs, and poison. Sorcery (witchcraft in 
			KJV) is one of the works of the flesh as listed in<strong><em> Galatians 5:20</em></strong>.<br />
			<br />
			<em><strong>SEDUCERS</strong></em>: Some scholars feel that the seducers or impostors of 
			<strong><em>II 
			Timothy 3:13</em></strong> may be translated sorcerer, wizard, or magician in 
			light of the mention of Jannes and Jambres in vs. 8. Still, the 
			context of the verse shows that this deceit will be in the area of 
			doctrine and not in the area of legitimate entertainment.<br />

    <div id="fragment-4">
        		Once a person has done any amount of study of these and other 
			related Scriptures and has any knowledge of the theatrical art of 
			illusion, he would immediately realize that the practices defined by 
			the above English and original Greek and Hebrew words are completely 
			foreign to anything anyone in my profession does today who uses the 
			title "magician." <br />
			<br />
			We do not tell the future, we do not try to communicate with the 
			dead, and we do not accomplish or claim to accomplish our effects by 
			the aid of demons or supernatural powers. In fact, when someone 
			arises on the scene that claims to possess some type of supernatural 
			power, it is usually the professional magicians who are the first to 
			investigate these claims in order to expose those who would benefit 
			at the expense of others by laying claim to these powers.<br />
			<br />
			Everything we do is for the purpose of entertainment and instruction 
			and is accomplished by natural means that usually involve a 
			tremendous amount of work and long hours of practice. As I have said 
			many times, any eight year old child can do the things I do--with 
			fifteen years of practice.<br />
			<br />
			Anytime I mention astrology, communication with the dead, or any 
			other form of the occult in my programs, it is either for the 
			purpose of dealing with these subjects from a Christian point of 
			view to alert people to the dangers of these subjects and their true 
			nature; or secondly, it is a matter of applying I Corinthians 
			9:21-23 by using a subject that audiences are interested in today as 
			a springboard to presenting the Gospel. When I do this I never 
			compromise my beliefs or deal with these subjects in an unscriptural 
			way.<br />
			<br />
			In everything I do my primary goal is to present the Lord Jesus 
			Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit in such an attractive and 
			meaningful manner that people will be drawn to Him. Over the years 
			thousands have prayed to receive Christ through this outreach, and I 
			have never heard of one person who has turned to the occult or other 
			practices condemned by Scripture as a result of witnessing my 
			performances; however, on the contrary I do know of hundreds who 
			have turned away from manmade or satanically influenced practices to 
			Christ.<br />
			<br />
			Magicians are legitimate deceptionists. They use their artistic 
			skill for the purpose of entertainment. "I love magicians because 
			they are honest men," said author Elbert Hubbard. "They tell you 
			they are going to fool you and then they proceed to do it. But no 
			matter what happens at the show, when you get home you will still 
			have your watch, your pocketbook, and your appendix. And that is 
			more than I can say for some of my non-magician acquaintances."<br />
			<br />
			In my particular case I do use my art to entertain people for their 
			momentary pleasure. But when my audience goes home, they not only 
			have their watches and pocketbooks, but they also leave with the 
			truth that the God of the Bible is still alive, the same today as 
			yesterday, and He offers them abundant life and love for now and 
			eternity through Jesus Christ.</div>
