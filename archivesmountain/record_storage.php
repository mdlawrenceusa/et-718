														Businesses must maintain books and records so that an accounting of the business activities can be 
														performed. Whether it is for an audited financial report, a compilation, a review, a tax return,

														support reports, tax returns and conclusions. The next important question is just how long must
														these business records be retained? We have prepared a Record Retention handbook that offers a
														suggested timeframe for maintaining records. <a href="" target="_blank">Click here</a> to download your free copy.
