												<h2>The Sapphire suppression system</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
												The Ansul SAPPHIRE™ suppression system has been developed as an 
												alternative to Halon 1301 that was banned from production in 1994. 
												The heart of the system is the revolutionary 3M Novec 1230 Fire Protection
												Fluid, a clear colorless and odorless clean agent. Stored in cylinders
												in its fluid form, Novec 1230 instantly vaporizes upon discharge,
												totally flooding protected spaces and absorbing heat better 
												than water. In tandem with a sophisticated ANSUL AUTOPULSE control 
												panel, the SAPPHIRE system suppresses a fire before it can start by detecting 
												it at invisible levels. And once the danger has passed, Novec 12320 quickly 
												evaporates without harming any valuable assets.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>
												This new fire protection system contains a breakthrough compound that provides tremendous environmental advantages over hydro fluorocarbons.

													This system utilizes a new sustainable chemical agent that 
													fights fires without causing damage to electronics, 
													works of art, irreplaceable artifacts and other critical 
													assets. It provides the ideal solution for hospitals, 
													museums, telecommunications centers and other facilities 
													seeking to protect critical assets that could be damaged 
													by ordinary fire suppression systems.

													The ANSUL® SAPPHIRE™ Suppression System uses 3M® NOVEC™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid. 
													It looks like water, but does not cause the type of damage associated with water when 
													putting out a fire. It can be used to protect rare exhibits, electronic equipment and 
													other delicate items without causing any harm. The fire protection fluid will quickly 
													evaporate, safeguarding these items and leaving them unaffected.
													<br><br>
													SAPPHIRE Suppression Systems offer central storage and modular 
													design solutions that can work in tandem with existing building 
													fire alarm and suppression systems. The agent is stored in pressurized 
													containers as a liquid and vaporizes when discharged. Other benefits of 
													the SAPPHIRE System include an atmospheric lifetime of only five days, 
													versus 33 years for the closest chemical alternative, as well as zero 
													ozone depletion. In addition, the SAPPHIRE Suppression System offers the 
													greatest safety margin over other non-sustainable halocarbon alternatives.
