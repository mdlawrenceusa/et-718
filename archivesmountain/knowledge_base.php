										<span class="important">FACTA – (Fair & Accurate Credit Transactions Act)</span>
										<p>Effective June 2005, this law requires businesses that collect customer information to 
										ensure that the information is protected from "unauthorized access or use." In addition, 
										the Disposal Rule requires that when such information is discarded, by shredding, burning or 
										pulverizing, it must be appropriately destroyed. The federal government's website states that 
										"although the Disposal Rule applies to consumer reports and the information derived from consumer 
										reports, the Federal Trade Commission encourages those who dispose of any records containing a 
										consumer's personal or financial information to take similar protective "<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/shutdown.html" target="blank">pa/2005 /06/disposal.htm</a></p>

										<span class="important">FISMA– (Federal Information Security Management Act)</span>
										<p>The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is designed to 
										ensure appropriate security controls for government information and is governed 
										by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is responsible 
										for all standards and guidelines with respect to the regulation. Enacted in the 
										United States in 2002, it provides a framework to protect federal information and assets. 
										The Act focuses on bolstering computer and network security within the federal government 
										and government contractors by mandating annual audits.</p>

										<span class="important" style="text-align: center">Objectives to Meet FISMA Compliance</span>

										<p>FISMA requires that all federal government systems comply with its regulations. Government 
										systems subject to more strict security measures, such as those governing information on national 
										security, are considered in compliance. The Act emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, 
										document and implement an organization-wide program to provide information security for the information 
										systems that support its operations and assets. This rule requires strong monitoring systems within 
										government agencies and companies that do business with the government. Security information and event 
										management (SIEM) is required for, and plays a vital role in, FISMA compliance. Using the technical 
										guidance set forth by the NIST, RSA has mapped reports to help covered entities comply with FISMA.</p>

										<p>To address FISMA requirements, companies must be able to address the following objectives:</p>

										<ul class="circle">
											<li>Access Control monitors attempts to access the company’s financial reporting system or the data that feeds the system.</li>
											<li>Configuration Control monitors the configuration, policies and software installed on systems covered by Sarbanes-Oxley and all 
												systems with access to that system.</li>
											<li>Malicious software detection capabilities collect and report malicious activities caused by viruses or other malicious code 
												from a wide variety of sources with centralized analysis.</li>
											<li>Policy Enforcement verifies that all users are complying with regulations to reduce the chance of accidental exposure of sensitive information.</li>
											<li>User Monitoring and Management creates a complete audit of the activities of non-employees with access to private data and takes steps to 
												minimize the risk from compromised accounts.</li>
											<li>Environment & transmission security involves the ongoing monitoring of the environment to ensure that security threats are detected and corrected as quickly as 
												possible through proactive measure such as VA scans. Additional monitoring is required to ensure that the transmission of sensitive data is secured 
												and done with the proper encryption levels.</li>
										</ul>

										<span class="important">HIPAA –</span><span>(Health Insurance -Portability and Accountability Act)</span>
										<p>This 1996 law and the accompanying 2002 regulation known as the 
										Privacy Rule restrict how health care providers may handle and disclose patient 
										health information. In general, health care entities must ensure that only approved 
										personnel handle protected health information and then only for purposes specified 
										in the law and regulation. Tru-Recovery can help your business comply with these requirements by:,</p>

										<ul class="circle">
											<li>Storing protected health information in a secure commercial records center</li>
											<li>Storing electronic files on our secure servers</li>
											<li>Signing a business associate agreement with your medical practice to limit your liability for stored health information</li>
											<li>Destroying inactive medical records in accord with state medical society guidance and in compliance with HIPAA regulations</li>
											<li>Converting paper medical files to encrypted electronic files.</li>
													<ul style="margin-left: 23px">
														<li>Save office space</li>
														<li>Provide easy access to records</li>
														<li>Limit access only to individuals you provide with designated passwords and encryption software.</li>
													</ul>
										</ul>

										<span class="important">GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT</span>
										<p>Signed into law on November 12, 1999 the GLBA mandates that financial institutions are to establish appropriate 
										administrative, technical and physical safeguards for customer records and information. Section III.C.1 of the Guidelines 
										requires financial institutions to adopt measures to protect customer information. If a financial institution is found to be 
										non-compliant with the rules, or to have deficiencies in its administrative, technical or physical safeguards, the regulatory 
										agencies have the responsibility and authority to take enforcement measures. Enforcement measures range from corrective actions 
										to fines or other penalties.Tru-Recovery can help your business comply with this law by:</p>
										<ul class="circle">
											<li>Storing sensitive hard copy information in our secure commercial records center.</li>
											<li>Limiting access to sensitive information only to individuals you approve in advance.</li>
											<li>Shredding and recycling discarded documents including sensitive paper documents and electronic media to prevent identity theft</li>
										</ul>


										<span class="important">SARBANES-OXLEY ACT</span>
										<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to enact "disclosure controls and security procedures" to ensure reporting of material 
										information affecting the company.</p>

										<p>This 2002 legislation creates new requirements for businesses and accountants to maintain corporate audit records or review 
										working papers for five years beyond the year in which an audit is concluded. The new law also creates penalties for destroying 
										or altering documents that are relevant to contemplated or ongoing investigations or official actions. Tru-Recovery can help businesses 
										and accounting firms and their clients comply with the law by:</p>

										<ul class="circle">
											<li>Establishing a retention and destruction schedule for audit documents that complys with federal law</li>
											<li>Storing audit records off site to limit the potential for tampering or inappropriate destruction</li>
											<li>Creating electronic versions of paper records to provide "back ups" of original documents in the event the originals are inadvertently lost, altered, or destroyed.</li>
										</ul>

										<span class="important">CHECK 21</span>
										<p>In what will be a major technological change for the banking industry, President Bush signed into law in 2003, 
										the Check 21 bill, which allows banks to substitute electronic check images for paper checks for the clearance and settlement process. 
										The bill paves the way for the industry to save billions of dollars and speed the processing of checks.</p>

										<p>The law calls for the use of "Image Replacement Documents" (IRD) to be implemented within a year. Bank IT managers 
										say the success of such systems, which will include branch-based scanning systems, data repositories and automated processing applications, 
										will depend largely on changing customer attitudes.</p>
