														Click on the picture to initiate your speed test. The Speakeasy Speed Test requires the latest version of 
														Macromedia Flash Player installed to use with your preferred browser.
														<br>
														<br>
														Also, temporarily disable any Adblock extensions on your browser.
														<br>
														By measuring the download and upload rate from one of the following locations you will be able to accurately judge your current line throughput or internet connection speed.

												<h2>Interpreting Your Speed Test Results</h2>
												<p>
													Download is a measure of how fast your connection delivers content to your 
													computer or local area network. With most web pages and basic email programs 
													you'll find little difference between, for instance, a 1.5MB download and a 3.0MB 
													download. However, for large files or a connection used by a large number of people a 
													lower download speed can be the difference between a quality broadband experience and a frustrating one.
												</p>
												<p>
													Upload is the measure of how fast content is delivered from your computer or local 
													area network to others on the Internet. To achieve optimal delivery of T1 or SDSL 
													services, download and upload speed should match or at least be very close. 
													This is very important for applications like VoIP, email, on-line gaming and 
													other interactive programs. Upload speed is even more important if you are 
													operating an email, web or file server at your location.
												</p>
												<p>
													Many broadband providers, especially cable and phone companies, 
													see broadband as another broadcast medium and don't tailor their 
													connections for optimal upload speeds. The bottom line is that it's 
													important to not underestimate the importance of upload speeds, 
													especially if you use the MozyPro application.
												</p>
												<p>
													Kbps transfer rate = kilobit per second transfer rate. 
													There are 8 bits in a byte, so we would divide kbps by 8 to get KB/sec transfer rate
												</p>
												<p>
													The following picture is a sample result using the speed test.
												</p>
												<div>
													<img src="images/speed1.jpg" alt="Speed test image" style="float: left; padding-right: 15px; overflow: hidden;">
													<p>
														Notice that the upload speed (109 kbps) is not adequate to support backing up files to the net. 
														As a rule of thumb, you should be looking for a minimum download speed of 1.5mg and an upload speed of 768kbps.
													</p>
													<p>	
														Check with your Internet provider. The additional cost to upgrade to a faster service is often negligible.
