											<h2>Media Storage</h2>

											<span class="important">What does off-site Media Storage mean?</span>
											<p>
												Company critical data must be backed up and taken off site and stored in a secure 
												location immune from site-level damage. This is called offsite Media Storage and it 
												not only makes common sense but moving data to a separate, off-site location - called vaulting - 
												dilutes risk and protects against data loss. The absolute need for 24x7x365 availability demands 
												that the backup and offsite vaulting and archiving processes are failsafe. Archives Mountain guarantees it!
											</p>

											<span class="important">How much does it cost to provide this protection for my company’s data resources?</span>
											<p>The monthly cost usually varies depending on the following:</p>											
											<ul class="circle">
												<li>Number of courier pickups/deliveries in a month</li>
												<li>Amount of transactions</li>
												<li>Storage costs associated with providing a secure data vault.</li>
												<li>Other costs associated with emergency services.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Archives Mountain can now offer you a fixed monthly fee at exceptional cost savings! 
												Go to the Contact US tab on the website and send us the information and we will be 
												happy to send you a message with an estimate of monthly costs for your company.
